# Portfolio Backlog

## Decisions
- Need to decide if I want to have markdown folders _or_ if I want to have a naming scheme instead (this would potentially make it easier to display all the files as background cards)
    - Maybe I can place all markdown folders into a larger markdown folder? This way all the content will be grabbed for the cards but I can still have it organized

## Necessary Functionality
- [x] Spheres swell when hover
- [x] Show info on hover
- [x] Expand into modal when clicked
- [x] Spheres can be customized for different modal content, either via attribute or hard-coded (using an attribute is ideal...)
- [ ] Modal holds information related to sphere customization
- [x] Multiple spheres work indpendently of each other
- [x] Markdown viewer library for modal
- [x] Grab content from respective folders
- [ ] Profile page
- [ ] Activity feed
- [ ] Portfolio page with grid for content (somehow make responsive and dynam ic??)
- [ ] SPLASH/LOADING PAGE BEFORE SPHERES ARE READY
    - Once I figure out how users will interact, provide that information on this page! I can also put a small notification guy in the bottom left corner or something as a reminder with a button to close the popup
- [x] Favicon

## Beautification
- [ ] Spheres have hover physics (Cannon)
- [ ] Spheres are attached to the center sphere with lines (either rigid or wavy)
- [x] Modal ~~open~~ fade-in animation
- [x] Modal **explosion** animation
- [ ] Push around the spheres with the mouse (not super far), but they gravitate back to their original spot
- [X] Hide the scrollbar in modals or make the right-hand side still curved as intended
- [ ] More responsive sphere hover ease


## Background Cards
- [ ] Create little background cards for every markdown file
- [ ] Give background cards color (washed out, muted, kinda blurry) (i may be able to make these one-dimensional and have them face the camera but that could be cheap)
- [ ] Make them fly into their respective sphere when that sphere is hovered
- [ ] Glassy appearance effect?

## Optional/Stretch Goals
- [ ] Putting text on a flat visible card instead of wrapping it, still allowing it to face the user but being obviously on a card
