**TL;DR: I've added a few more small things, but I'm going to pivot and avoid forcing myself into a single idea. This one is cool, but I constantly have ideas that may benefit from rapid prototyping.**

# Workworkwork

As evidenced by the 12 days since my last post (in *Portfolio Website*) I've been busy. My internship started, and I'm doing some really cool stuff, but it's been consuming a lot of my time as well as with driving to/from home and school. I'm leaning into it heavy to establish good rapport and build useful skills, but that means less time for VR.

I've been daunted by creating effective systems for my game, and unfortunately have put it off by telling myself "it'll come to me". This is not true. However, I've also become disillusioned with hand tracking for this game since it resembles something with hand tracking thrown in, as opposed to feeling like it was meant for it. I know for a fact that hand tracking is cumbersome and feels strange, and I'm a sucker for yummy haptics... which I'm not getting here.

That's not to say I'm dropping this game! Rather, I want to see what happens with cranking out many small ideas, because I have ideas for things all the time. I'm thinking of this like a music artist with plenty of demos, fleshing them out into full songs if/when they revisit them. I have another one right now that I want to try - some cool space battle stuff. I have NO idea what the scoping looks like. But I've also gotten my hands dirty with hand tracking and learned about that, so maybe it's time to learn other areas anyway! 

## More, more, more!

I *have* added more since my last post to this topic, though. There's an environment now with torches and flames. I wanted to attach point lights to every 1/20 embers with 5 able to exist at once...

...per torch...

...

yeah.

It's still pretty good though, I learned about shaders and how different people construct fire. I did see some Unreal Engine fire tech though... if only.

I made the Cardinal Artifact hand poses less painful, an embarrassing thing to need to fix. But they're so much better, less strict, and with **much** better orientation detection for both comfort and ease.

Last, but not least, lit candles can now be used to light unlit candles! This was surprisingly difficult and still imperfect, but it works! I'm a strong believer that small interactions create rich experiences. Like, why would you give a player a candle and a psuedo- physics-based world, and *not* let them blow it out with a sweep of their hand (also improved) or pinch the wick, or light it with another candle.... you can't expect a user to forget about reality if you don't give them the room to breathe and explore. I want to create those interactions.

I'm reasonably confident that I have not even scratched the surface of immersive interactions like this, but a crazy physics engine like Boneworks/Bonelab or Beyond Sandbox is not the only way to create immersion.

###### Deceptive to implement, enrapturing to use.

## In sum

In summary, I like this project, and I may return to it, but I think that I don't know enough just yet to do this the way I want. I'll have to be careful with that mindset - "I don't know enough yet" - but it could take me far. I worry about exploring other ideas at the risk of not being able to ship anything, since I want to finish *an* experience, regardless of whether it gets published or if I make any money.

I just don't want to confine myself too quickly, and rapid prototyping is a good skill. I'm enjoying what I'm learning, I just don't want to **force** myself to do anything even if I'm pressured by dreams of professional VR design/dev and inspiring others. This space game I want to make could be pretty cool, if I start out simple enough - I'm thinking ship battles. The big kind.

I have a working understanding of hand tracking systems and how to create small interactions with events and message passing, useful skills for VR moving forward - we'll see what happens.

Cheers!
