**TL;DR: I added some lovely collapsible topics to give myself the room to spam and enthuse over all the VR I'm learning. My other work needs to be seen too!**

# It was inevitable
I've been pouring hours into learning VR lately, and there's so much I want to talk about! However, I really don't want to blow up my only activity feed. Enter collapsible topics; as soon as I started realizing how often I was likely to update this website, I knew I needed a better solution. It nagged at me for a few days, but now I have a simple way of separating ideas. It only allows me to go one folder deeper into my *activity* or *portfolio* folders, but for now that is fine. It shouldn't be too egregious to upgrade if I really need to do it that bad, since I've laid the groundwork already. But now, everything is just so much cleaner on the site and in my files.

###### I am so enamored with this setup. I love writing my markdown, pushing to main, and being done in 20 minutes. 

I was surprised I managed to do it in one sitting (four hours on a summer friday), but glad I got it over with. I may need to make more changes to the styling to make it easier on the eyes and easier to read, but I wanted to get this out of the way. 

Lots of regex, scripting, styling, and hair-pulling later and my website looks better than it did a few hours ago. Plus, my code is that much more modular. 

I am coming for you viscerally, Unity Game Engine with Meta Quest 2 and Jason Jerald's *The VR Book*.
