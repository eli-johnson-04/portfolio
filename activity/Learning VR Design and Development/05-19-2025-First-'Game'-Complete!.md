**TL;DR: I finished the 3.5-hour tutorial in about 7 hours! The game is small, but complete with a start menu, narrative, locomotion, common interactables, audiovisual affordances, immersive illusions, and more. I'm learning to love the process, and stoked about starting my own projects!**

# Baby Steps
The process was **slow**, but I'm finished! One finished game (and many notes) later, and I am ready to get my hands dirty. I'm amazed by how much work went into a relatively small experience, but I have developed an intuition for how these systems work and it will be faster the next time around.

###### A collage of all the notes I took. Lots of editor screenshots, every script I wrote, connections between concepts, self-notes, and anything else I didn't want to have to Google to figure out.

From my own experience and after reading so much of *The VR Book*, there were so many instances where I saw room to expand, polish to add, comfort I should include, and things I wanted to do. I'll get into that soon, but first let's look at all the cool features I put together! Most of the models, animations, and sound were prepared in advance, but I am proud to say I assembled the experience.

<!-- I intend to develop these skills since I have my own universes I want to bring to life. -->

## Demo
Here's a demo! The game is not long, but it's got some tasks to keep the user engaged with affordances and ambience to encourage exploration. 
<!-- youtube channel, make a no-commentary montage and embed it here! maybe see if clicking a button/link can navigate to a specific section of the video, or see if i can embed at a specific timecode?? -->

## Skills learned
- Unity 3D & VR setup with Universal Render Pipeline
- Customizing hands and animating hand motion
- Assembling an environment with a skybox, lighting, and post-processing
- Interactors vs interactables: direct, socket, ray, teleport interactors; grab, poke, lever, knob, climb interactables; attach transforms vs dynamic attach; physics-based interactions; behavior triggered by interactions
- Locomotion mediators and providers: continuous and snap turn; continuous move and teleporting; teleportation areas and anchors; basic material creation and shaders vection and motion illusions
- Comfort and motion sickness considerations
- Scene hierarchy considerations
- Timelining: audio tracks; activation tracks; signal tracks, emitters, and receivers; linking timeline events to interactions; audio sources and ambience; scene ordering and transitions
- Audio and visual affordance systems, triggering audio with interactions
- Optimizing for multiple platforms considering environment, complexity, scripts, visual effects, static objects, lighting, reflections, physics, project settings, and culling
- Building for multiple platforms

## The floating-point precision's the limit
I know the ropes, now I can learn to swing. I might still make that fishing game, or maybe I'll make a roguelike horde survivor, who knows. But first I'm going to play *In Death* because I've earned it. Shout out to this one title from SÃ³lfar Studios that used to make me shiver with the religious horror accompanied by choral ambience. I revisited it a few days ago and wow, VR has made serious strides since 2018, but I still had to muster some courage for this one.

Ohhhhh yeah. See ya.
