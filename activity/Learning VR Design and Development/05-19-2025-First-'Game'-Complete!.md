**TL;DR: I finished the 3.5-hour tutorial in about 7 hours! The game is small, but complete with a start menu, narrative, locomotion, common interactables, audiovisual affordances, immersive illusions, and more. I'm learning to love the process and stoked to author my own universes.**

# Baby Steps
The process was **slow**, but I'm finished! One finished game (and many notes) later, and I am ready to get my hands dirty. I'm amazed by how much work went into a relatively small experience, but I have developed an intuition for how these systems work and it will be faster the next time around.

###### A collage of all the notes I took. Lots of editor screenshots, every script I wrote, connections between concepts, self-notes, and anything else I didn't want to have to Google to figure out.

From my own experience and after reading so much of *The VR Book*, there were so many instances where I saw room to expand, polish to add, comfort I should include, and things I wanted to do. I'll get into that soon, but first let's look at all the cool features I put together! Most of the models, animations, and sound were prepared in advance, but I am proud to say I assembled the experience.

<!-- I intend to develop these skills since I have my own universes I want to bring to life. -->

### Demo
The game is not long, but it's got some tasks to engage the user with affordances and ambience to encourage exploration.

###### Rough around the edges, but yeah, that's expected. 

## Skills learned
- Unity 3D & VR setup with Universal Render Pipeline
- Customizing hands and animating hand motion
- Assembling an environment with a skybox, lighting, and post-processing
- Interactors vs interactables: direct, socket, ray, teleport interactors; grab, poke, lever, knob, climb interactables; attach transforms vs dynamic attach; physics-based interactions; behavior triggered by interactions
- Locomotion mediators and providers: continuous and snap turn; continuous move and teleporting; teleportation areas and anchors; basic material creation and shaders vection and motion illusions
- Comfort and motion sickness considerations
- Scene hierarchy considerations
- Timelining: audio tracks; activation tracks; signal tracks, emitters, and receivers; linking timeline events to interactions; audio sources and ambience; scene ordering and transitions
- Audio and visual affordance systems, triggering audio with interactions
- Optimizing for multiple platforms considering environment, complexity, scripts, visual effects, static objects, lighting, reflections, physics, project settings, and culling
- Building for multiple platforms

## Skills I want to learn
- Physics-based interactions/animations, fingers wrap around objects
- Comfort considerations, vignettes, swapping turn controls
- UI and deeper VR UXD/human-centered design
- Level design, modeling, texturing, animations, sound design
- More expansive experiences
- Weapons systems and health controllers
- Narrative incorporation
- Lighting and graphics
- Pushing immersion limits, creating the most compelling experiences, dropping a banger, getting famous, retiring, dying with a legacy, yadda yadda yadda

## The floating-point precision's the limit
I don't want to say too much; I've already said a lot in the last few posts. The basics are good and now it's time to test the limits of the system as I learn what I'm capable of. I want to innovate, to make something new and refreshing that hooks people and doesn't let go. Honestly, words have always bothered me, so why not force people to see everything how I see it? VR is the perfect way to give all the nuance, all the context, and all the small, rich details of an experience, with all the room in the world to put someone in whatever shoes I want. I want to do this so bad, and if I don't, someone else will. 

I know the ropes, now I learn to swing. I might still make that fishing game, or maybe I'll make a roguelike horde survivor, who knows. But first I'm going to play *In Death* because I've earned it. Shout out to this one title from SÃ³lfar Studios that used to make me shiver with the religious horror and choral ambience. I revisited it a few days ago and wow, VR has made serious strides since 2018, but I still had to muster some courage for this one.

Ohhhhh yeah. See ya.
