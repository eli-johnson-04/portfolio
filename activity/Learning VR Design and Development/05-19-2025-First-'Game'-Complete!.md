From my own experience and after reading so much of *The VR Book*, there were so many instances where I saw room to expand, polish to add, comfort I should include, and things I wanted to do.

Most of the models, animations, and sound were prepared in advance, but I am proud to say I assembled the experience.

<!-- I intend to develop these skills since I have my own universes I want to bring to life. -->
