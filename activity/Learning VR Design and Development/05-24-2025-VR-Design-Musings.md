**TL;DR: **

# A few thoughts

As I highlight more and more of my bible, *The VR Book*, it's been so fascinating to learn how much biology plays into our experiences (...obviously) and the role that our biological and perceptual experiences play in the design of everyday things. Speaking of, I haven't yet read Don Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*, but what kind of designer would I be if I didn't (I ordered it between starting and finishing this sentence)? For VR especially, I cannot believe the complexity and interconnectedness of our audiovisual and physical sensory perception and how it impacts the way we experience an environment.

And how hard VR design is as a result.

What an incredible idea to find that designing every aspect of an experience intended for the most complex computer known to man is one of the most complex ways to design!

## Biology

I've known that foveated rendering is a thing for a while now. The idea of using eye tracking to render lower quality everywhere that you are not looking to save performance is super cool tech, and something that makes so much sense to exist. It's perfect design-wise; if executed well you couldn't figure out it was happening even if you wanted to **and** it only serves to benefit the system (at the cost of tracking delay). But to see the diagram 

<!-- Mention the cool stuff i've been learning from The VR Book and from my conversation with jonny last night about Foveated Rendering and how Half-Life Alyx is one of the few games that is actually kinda transformative, and how the best design is invisible, and how i haven't read Don Norman's Design of Everyday Things but i am going to (ideally order it before writing this post) and anything else I want to mention-->
