**TL;DR: Longstanding issues fixed, new features coming soon, and I'm enrolled in VR development for the fall!**

# Fixes, features, and the future, oh my!
Today I **finally** center-justified the text on the spheres. It's been, what, 5 months? I've been too busy and too daunted by my `TODO`'s, so I put it off until now. Nonetheless I got it working, and (somewhat) revamped my text geometry generation system. 

I was also able to allow reopening of the welcome popup, just in case. It also looks nice to have it fade into the corner and stick around, so, win-win. 

## Particles for each markdown file
I have been, since the beginning, wanting to add individual particles or cards or representative objects of some kind. The goal was to have one for each markdown file and they would correspond to the spheres that contain that file's content. So, for example, five markdown files in the portfolio = five dedicated objects somewhere off in the distance. I attempted to do this with particles today, but I spent plenty of time in class and plenty of time working on other aspects of the site that I have resolved to finish it soon, but not today. 

## Today's lecture takeaways
### Networking
Today in my networking fundamentals course, I learned about how network devices are assigned IP addresses using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Everything in this class has felt like common sense - like "wow, that makes so much sense! I understand perfectly why this is done this way", until I attempt to remember it myself. Certainly a testament to the ingenuity of those who design these things. 

Networking is pretty cool; it has been fascinating to learn more about how devices connect and communicate over the internet, and to reiterate, the way it is done just makes *so much sense*. *Of course* we use packets and a standardized system of exchange, and *of course* IP addresses are masked by routers, and **of course** the internet is a cobbled-together web of a bunch of devices screaming into the void and praying they hear a response. Neat!

### Astrophysics
In astrophysics I learned about the layers of the Sun and derived formulas for the average speed of a particle in the Sun's corona, as well as the escape velocity necessary to escape the Sun, ...in the corona. I didn't know that we have names for the structures present in the outermost layers of the Sun, like spicules in the chromosphere (the burny flamey part above the dry rock-looking photosphere) or that the Sun's magnetic field flips every 11 years because the equator rotates faster than the poles, or that sunspots are present at the ends of magnetic field loops. It's all so fascinating. 

# tHe FuTuRe
I've been exceptionally inspired lately. Really looking into the games I enjoy, the projects I personally have created, some of the software I have used, and peers of mine that are artists have left me itching to create something. I have really been wanting to make a VR game, after nearly a decade in the space. I was dejected about the state of my website while working on it one day, and during some decompression I thought about making a VR game, but I was presented with this screen in the VR template and was not in the headspace to receive it well:

All was not lost, though. I registered for classes two days ago and managed to get into a class I was genuinely stoked about: *Introduction to Virtual Reality*, where I get to learn all about VR app development and the final project is a VR experience. Are you kidding me? If I was told 7 years ago, when I was getting into this, that I would have the skillset *and* the opportunity to make an experience on my own that *I* could enjoy, I would have refused to believe you. 

And now, I could not feel more alive thinking about it.
