I've got eight years of VR experience under my belt, so I'm not out of my depth or jumping into aphotic waters where I can't see because the light doesn't penetrate that deep. That said, this learning experience is by no means a quick one. I developed a cool hand-tracking gesture that detects open palm and activates a custom Hover Cast Interactor, which surprisingly only took a few hours as the first thing I've done in my own game! I tweaked the hover effects of my Hoverable component the next day with a state machine and an AnimationCurve for seamless transitions, and I feel so, so accomplished. I did something meaningful and created a rich interaction that makes a game *feel good* :D

You won't ***believe*** the ideas I have planned for this game. I'm creating a cosmology, some extreme self-body horror mechanics, I'm gonna make lots more gestures, and trying to keep the core mechanics relatively contained so I can use a simplistic story system.
