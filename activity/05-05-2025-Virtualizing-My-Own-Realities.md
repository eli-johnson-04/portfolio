**TL;DR: I am going to take VR development seriously, beginning this summer with Unity XR and combing the textbook for my fall '25 VR theory course. It's a leap of faith and I'm wary, but I'll regret it if I don't try.** 

# What if?
I've been stoked about the possibility of taking VR development seriously and putting in maximum effort over the summer. I wasn't able to secure a software internship, so why not spend my time learning how to create the worlds I see in my head when I listen to music? Or when I read? Or when I'm bored walking to class and look up at the sky, longing to see the stars again on their nightly dance across the phantasmagoric celestial sphere? I've been so, so excited.

*What if I gave this everything?*

## Of course they're called affordances!
I did some digging into where to start, and I began playing around in Unity's XR template, which I mentioned early last month. It wasn't as daunting this time, but it still felt like the editor was yelling at me. I was looking around in the scene hierarchy, and I laughed when I saw that the popouts and tooltips around my controller, or the teleport aiming line, among other things, were all called *affordances*. After taking a UXD class in fall '24, 7th grade me was seeing through a new lens, and he was giddy.

*Each tooltip and the teleport line are affordances, as they **afford** the player the ability to complete an action.*

I played around and got familiar with Unity's interface and XR system, and now I'm sitting down to properly learn, with enough knowledge to follow tutorials. I'm watching and taking notes on Valem Tutorials' 3-hour Unity VR tutorial, and I'm learning so much. I can see the possibilities, and my mind is constantly flooded with ideas for mechanics and interactions I never imagined I'd be learning how to make. 

> As an aside, I briefly considered working with Meta's fork of Unreal Engine since I have ideas for a game whose visuals could only be realized faithfully there. However, after blue-screening my laptop *twice* during compilation (I couldn't get one of the setup steps to work on my desktop), I decided to stick with Unity's shallower learning curve.

## One step at a time, buddy
I was looking forward to working on other projects as soon as I took this website live. On top of learning Unity, I registered for that VR course from my post in early April and I reached out to the professor about getting ahold of the syllabus, to which he replied with the previous one. Unfortunately, the course is not VR *development*, rather, it is about the theory behind when and where to apply VR, how to do so meaningfully, and how to design experiences that make sense in VR. 

I'm a little disappointed, but with a background in the field and a hardcopy of the textbook, Jason Jerald's *The VR Book*, I intend to have seen all of the content at least once before stepping foot in the first class. I want to use the class as an opportunity to hone my skills, so I'm going to do most of the learning beforehand.

That said, I certainly acknowledge the risk here. I don't know people in the industry, and I don't have friends with the same knowledge base as I. This is a leap of faith to truly test my limits like they have never been before, and while excited, I am certainly scared regarding employment after graduation in spring, exactly a year from now. Then again, people often overestimate how much they can do in a month, and underestimate what they can do in a year.

# To every infinite world, ad infinitum
I intend to post more and more about this as I have more and more to show off, but I wanted to make a first about the inception of this journey. I am likely to update this site to support categories or tags of some kind within my activities to segregate them, but nonetheless my journey embarks here. I have ideas, I have worlds I want people to experience, and I have a plan. 

I might also add WebXR here, just for fun. Who knows? :p
