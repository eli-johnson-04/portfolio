**TL;DR: Broke the website, fixed it again! The long journey is not over, but I win regardless.**

# The website is up (part 2)!!
I shared the URL with friends and colleagues, only to discover major performance issues. My spheres are made of way too many segments and it's slowing everything down. I didn't believe this was the case, and was tinkering with a slew of optimizations while trying to set up a separate development gh-pages site. 

So, I failed, and broke the deployment workflow, again. I was mired in frustration. Today, a full 26 hours later, I have resolved the issue and improved performance, as well as added some cool moon and dwarf planet textures to the spheres (with color changes) to give the appearance more personality. 

## I detest web dev. 
Yeah, pretty much. Frontend is the worst, I could definitely get behind backend, but anything related to deployment or hosting is not my wheelhouse, not right now. I don't like it, it's confusing, and only time will tell if we are star-crossed lovers or sworn enemies.

I have *thoroughly* enjoyed the process of bringing this creative vision to life, and it has been a joy to see the fruits of my labor. I am ready to work on other things, though, like trying to make some VR applications. I downloaded Unity in a bout of frustration with this site a few days ago, and was so daunted by the interface that I had to pull away from my work entirely. I will be coming back though, without this website weighing me down like it is now. 

## Somewhere out there...
Today I sent out my resume for the first time with the URL on it. A little terrifying, but it's wild to think I had no idea what I was doing for the first 10-20 hours I worked on this, and now I can confidently say that I love actualizing a vision, even if the process is vicious. Like this code:

*Why does this work? This has no reason to work. JavaScript is ridiculous, this is ugly, and I'm just glad it's never given me problems.*

I have learned so much about myself and what I will do when given free reign over a project. I've realized that, wow, maintaining your own code standards and style and remembering to use good programming practice is hard. However, without modularization, planning, and help, I would have failed a lot more, a lot sooner. I've refactored multiple times, broken my code, multiple times, and if I can do this, I can do anything.
