**TL;DR: **

# FINALLY a VR exercise ugh

We're finally doing a Unity tutorial on developing with Unity XR! I obviously spent a lot of time doing this over the summer, but being taught from the game engine's own learning platform has proved helpful. Except for having to install a 13 GB editor from a few years ago. Not cool. I have >100 GB of my stuff on OneDrive and yet I still have maybe 60 GB free at any given time...

Anyway.
