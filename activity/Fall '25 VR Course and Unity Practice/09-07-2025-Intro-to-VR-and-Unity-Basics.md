**TL;DR: Finally starting the course for which I read Jason Jerald's "The VR Book" and documenting classwork since I'm so busy with other courses and extracurriculars! Week 1 starts me off with Unity basics... easy peasy.**

# Starting the Course!

I've been thrilled to finally start the class I read the textbook for over the summer... and it's time! I won't fluff it.

Afforded the privilege of being taught by Dr. Alexandre Gomes de Siqueira has me positioned for success; I've been *exceptionally* busy but I still plan to go to his office hours and chat him up about project ideas and course content. Having read the textbook means I am familiar with all the course content, so every slide feels a little lackluster. In light of this, it genuinely has made the class a creative outlet, and I do get to have fun with all the exercises and projects, the purpose of reading the textbook and making these posts! We're tasked with following Unity Learn tutorials and submitting a video of our results, so most of the posts will be about my completed work for the class with embeds of the YouTube videos I submit for grades.

## Exercise 1 - Unity Basics

This exercise was about Unity basics, and was a breeze thanks to my summer efforts. We had to install Unity and customize a microgame, as well as answer a few questions about Unity and real time content creation. Pretty straightforward stuff - here's my video submission.

There's not much more to say, but next week should be more exciting... cheers!
