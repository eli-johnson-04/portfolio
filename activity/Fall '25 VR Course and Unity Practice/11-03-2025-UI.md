**TL;DR: For exercise 8 we got to choose the tutorial we wanted to do, and I don't know much about UI. Pefect time to learn! I can definitely build off of what I've gotten here, and I'm excited to apply it to new things!**

# User Interfaces!

This week's exercise (8) was pretty straightforward, we got to choose whichever one we wanted from Unity Pathways. Fire. I decided to do UI, since I don't know a whole lot about UI in VR just yet!

## Make a Canvas

The first thing I did was create an XR UI Canvas and position it on the back wall. I added an image and made it black & transparent so I could see the breadth of the Canvas on the wall, then I scaled and repositioned everything, making sure to have my layering correct. Last, I added some welcome text and matched the dimensions of the TextMeshPro - Text GameObject to the Canvas so everything looked positioned correctly!

## Add button to hide text

I then added a UI Button to hide the text. I played with the label on the Button and its colors and such, and made it so that it hides the display. Tight.

I also made it so that the hands don't consider the canvas or the text on it to be raycast targets. But it's not like it matters anyway since I can't connect my Quest 2 OR Quest 3 to this and the XR Interaction Simulator didn't let me move the hands this time.

## Make a Canvas to reset the UI

For this part I duplicated the welcome message Canvas and duplicated the button, but I changed its behavior. Now the button would call on a LoadScene script to reload the scene.

In order to show this menu, the user has to press the secondary button on the controller. To enable this I had to add an OnButtonPress script to the XR Rig, which enables me to use an action to define a set of behaviors. In this case, the secondary button on the controller will hide the welcome message, show the reset message, and teleport the XR Rig to a predefined teleportation anchor I made. Pretty sweet - it forces the user to see the message.

For this message, "nah." will disable the canvas, and "fr." will reload the scene.

## Poke Interactors

I also added poke interactors to the hands! Not like I can use them, but they're there now. If I were able to use the hands, this would make it so that I could push my hands into the UI instead of being forced to use the Ray Interactors on the XR Controllers.

I never would have considered to put these GameObjects into the UI layer, although that makes a lot of sense! This way I don't have to play with interaction layers at all. I love this. The only thing I would do moving forward, though, is to make sure I note in the name of the interactor that it is for UI only, if I were to use this strategy in the future.
