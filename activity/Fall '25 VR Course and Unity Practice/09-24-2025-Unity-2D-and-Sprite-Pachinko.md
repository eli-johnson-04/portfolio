**TL;DR: I learned plenty about 2D games in Unity during my summer '25 game dev course, but I still had a fun time with sprite pachinko.**

# Sprite Pachinko!

Exercise four was all about real-time 2D development in Unity - I had to use Collider 2D's, Rigidbody 2D's, and some assets I found online to make sprite pachinko using information about those things during the tutorial. It was funny, and I decided to make it silly and Halloween/fall themed with spooky pegs alongside a multilayer space backdrop. The penguin sprites I found were cute and funny so I made a bunch and had them fall at intervals instead of just the one that was required.

I also had to make some edge colliders to keep the penguins constrained to the play area, which took some careful tweaking to get right. I like that the pegs all spin around and the penguins roll all over the place with their circle colliders hehehehe - have a look! I recorded in Zoom again, so again the framerate is kinda stinky (I'd really like to get away from Zoom).

Until next week... big things are coming!
