**TL;DR: This week's exercise got me some practice with cameras, lighting, constructing environments, and using basic phyiscs. I decided to have some fun with my own textures!**

# Exercise 2 - Real Time 3D

I did this one a bit early since they're always due on Sundays and I didn't want to think about it over the weekend. My weekends are mine!

For EX2 I had to demonstrate knowledge of cameras, lighting, small-scale environment creation, and a basic understanding of simulating physics with colliders, rigidbodies, and physics materials. This was done by having some balls and objects fall inside a scene and then creating a marble track for the second part. Unfortunately I was recording in Zoom so the framerate is less than stellar, but the noodleball makes me giggle.

After seeing my friend's submission for EX1, I remembered I could take creative liberty. So I had more fun with this one. My dog Cicero is in there say hi :)
