**TL;DR: This week I brushed up on scripting and spatial audio with some creepy sound effects in an otherwise warm and welcoming scene. And also toiled to make use of 19 orc voice lines... I couldn't choose just one.**

# Exercise 3 - Real-Time 3D Development

I had fun with this one - I got to make my noodleball from last week freak out using some funny transform scripting, and I did some silly audio stuff in the second part. Once again my work from the summer helped me out and made it a breeze to get through the exercise. The first half was easy whatever whatever blahblahblah but for the second part... for the second part I had to create a moving object in the scene that had audio, I had to use static 3D audio, and I had to have background audio.

I was browsing for sounds to choose from and naturally I had to use the [Urok the Orc - Orcish Voice Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/voices/urok-the-orc-orcish-voice-pack-301101) (I know you want to use it too I gotchu ;)) with 19 voice lines and I made a giant hamburger float outside the window on a sinusoidal track and randomly choose one every few seconds... as one does.

Also as one is naturally inclined to do, I put a creepy static-y noise on a giant hotdog in the corner to add some freaky ambience. The hardest part of this exercise, surprisingly, was mixing the volumes to make them intelligible at their respective ranges. Oh yeah, and, all the audio is 3D - it had to be. Check it out!

I also learned about real-time creators and the roles they may take when working with or adjacent to a game engine. They typically split into art/design and programming, which have 10 or more common job titles underneath those umbrellas. I'd love to be a gameplay programmer, AR/VR designer/developer, or some kind of **immersion** or **interaction** expert. That sounds like a dream come true.
