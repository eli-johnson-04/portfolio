**TL;DR: This exercise was cool, it extended my knowledge of UI and taught me how to use the UI for user comfort modulation. Important stuff! I also reinforced my understanding of direct and ray interactors, essential tools in the VR developer's immersion crafting kit.**

# Part 1: Direct vs Ray Interactors

In this week's exercise, I learned more about things I'd say I already know pretty well. That said, there's no better way to mastery than repeated review and practice! I've also been super busy, so these exercise logs are likely to get a bit more concise. Last week's certainly did, but it can be expected now that the semester is coming to a close soon.

## Set up a Direct Interactor

I set up an XR Direct Interactor on the Right Controller and removed the Ray Interactor. However, I made sure to copy over the haptic and audio feedback that the Ray had set up, since we wanted those things to exist as well.

###### Also made sure to include a sphere collider trigger, since the Direct Interactor needs a collision volume!

## Rebuild Ray Interactions

I went back into the left hand and modified its Ray Interactor to use a new Interaction Layer called "Raycasts", so that I could specify which objects the Interactor can, well, **interact** with. I also went through and made all of my teleportation anchors and areas use the Raycasts Interaction Layer, since the Ray Interactors are used for teleporting in this version of the XRI Toolkit.

I then duplicated this LeftHand Ray twice, one for both hands, and then I copied the Direct Interactor + Sphere Collider setup from the Right Controller onto the left. Now there are four controllers, two with Direct Interactors and two with Ray Interactors, with one of each for each hand.

## Toggling Direct and Ray Interactors

Now comes the fun part, allowing the user to switch their interaction mode. On the LeftHand/RightHand Ray objects, I added a Toggle Ray component that came with the tutorial files and placed their corresponding Direct Interactor GameObjects in the Direct Interactor reference slots, and went back into each of their controllers to add an On Button Press component (also from the tutorial files).

###### This is for the RightHand Ray. The LeftHand Ray looks the exact same, except it has a reference to the LeftHand Controller GameObject.

I added two bindings to each of the On Button Press components, which were the primary button and the thumbstick press for the corresponding controller. Each On Button Press also got an action that held the LeftHand/RightHand Ray GameObject references and would toggle their rays. Now we have a functioning Direct/Ray swap system for each hand! For a demo, check out the video at the end :)

###### This is for the RightHand Controller. The LeftHand Controller looks the exact same, except it has the same bindings for the LeftHand XR Controller and talks to the LeftHand Ray instead!

This tutorial was solid - it gave me a better understanding of how to use multiple interactors to afford the user the ability to do multiple things. This is a powerful tool in the developers belt, as having seamless transitions between intuitive (and often expected) interaction modes is essential to creating an immersive, unforgettable experience.

# Part 2: Comfort and Accessibility

This tutorial focuses more on user comfort and allowing the user to customize their comfort settings from within a UI menu. This tutorial directly follows the one I did for the previous post, and as such is built on top of its UI.

## Black Screen on Camera

This part was cool, I didn't know anything about how to do this. I created a Canvas and changed its Render Mode to Screen Space - Camera, which allows it to show up on the screen of the referenced camera (in my case, the Main Camera from the XR Rig). Now I could make a black image, make it huge, and put it super close to the camera to fill the whole field of view.

###### I raised the alpha from 0 to 1 to make the canvas visible for this picture, I have it set to 0 for the Fade Canvas component (provided with tutorial) to work.

## Make the Black Screen Fade-in

I had to add some stuff to this new canvas, but I also had to make a Scene Loader object in the hierarchy with an On Scene Load component (provided with tutorial). Here I could specify behavior set to occur after the scene loads... obviously.

###### I demo this at the end of the post!

I also made it so that teleportation surfaces have fade-ins to prevent vection, the feeling of perceived physical motion when none is occuring. Vection is my favorite tactic for heightening immersion and inducing presence, since it's so hard to do without making people sick but can be so compelling. To do this, I just added some tutorial-provided components. Yeah. Kinda boring. No screenshot here, I just went into prefab mode on my teleportation mats (the big blue boxes in previous sdcreenshots) and replaced anything containing "Teleportation Anchor" with "Teleportation Anchor With Fade", and anything containing "Teleportation Area" with "Teleportation Area With Fade", then copied the parameters from each of the formers onto the latters.

## Settings Panel

Here I duplicated the welcome UI from the last tutorial and added a little gear-lookin' icon guy in the bottom left that will show the new settings panel, a cool dude with some toggles! These toggles are attached to dynamic bools on the XR Rig that can enable/disable Snap Turning and Interation Layers for distanced grabbing. This was surprisingly tedious to set up, just because I was frustrated and nearing the end of a long session of work. It works, but I cannot demo it for you because I do not have that level of control over the interaction simulator for some reason, and, as expected, my headsets don't like Unity 2022.3.

###### The "X" closes this panel and returns to the welcome screen. Boom.
