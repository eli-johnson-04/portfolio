# A UX Deep Dive

Working alongside a team of two others, I collaborated on the planning and design for a new app called University of Florida Freshman Foundations (UFFF). The aim of the app is to provide the set of students who may be under-prepared for their first time living alone with a curated selection of guides and tutorials for nearly everything. This was the culmination of a semester's worth of learning in my UXD course. We designed the app as an extensible service that could be pitched to universities for integration with their student email systems, like UF's GatorLink. This way, each university can subscribe to the same service while offering information that may be more specialized for their school such as school systems and the area around the campus.

Per our chosen delegation of responsibilities I was tasked with creating the final prototype, which I sank my teeth into and siezed as an opportunity for creative freedom. Figma is quite a powerful tool, and it was a joy to see this app come together. Try it out!

## Features

We devised the following solutions to address the problem of accessible resources for the "life" part of university life. The checkmarks indicate those that made it into the final high-fidelity prototype above:

- [✓] UF SSO or sign up with email
- [✓] User accounts for personalization/recommendations
- [✓] Intuitive landing page with search bar
- [✓] Search bar suggestions
- [✓] Navigable categories list (exercise, food/nutrition/shopping, studying tips, Gainesville, etc.) with icons
- [✓] Articles for specific tasks/subjects
- [✓] Saving/bookmarking articles
- [✓] Tab for bookmarked articles
- [✓] Conscientious signifiers for navigation/interaction affordances
- [✓] Back buttons, share buttons, scrolling effects, visual feedback
- [✓] Sign-out button on landing page
- [✓] Discussion section underneath each post
- [✓] Gainesville-specific information for UF
- Articles with interactive media, task lists (cooking, to-do, etc), and more for user engagement and richer tutorial experience
- Accessibility options (screen readers, dark mode, etc.)
- Support for multiple languages
- Allow users to share their own thoughts and solutions


## UXD Artifacts

Employing many important strategies and techniques for thoughtful, educated, human-centered design, we generated essential artifacts of the design process:

- Miro board with our lean UX canvas (bottom right), updated through the design process. The lean UX canvas includes the Business Problem, Business Outcomes, Users & Customers, User Benefits, and Solution Ideas.

- Interviews from think-aloud sessions
- Wireframes, paper wireflows, low- and high-fidelity prototypes

# Project Legacy

This project was an invaluable experience for getting neck-deep in the UXD process and reinforcing the UX learning I did in Summer '24 while designing for The Ark Foundation in Ghana. I was able to directly employ principles of effective, intuitive design by striving to understand the users, whom we carefully selected from and outside the target audience. We made sure to carefully craft affordances, provide signifiers when the affordances are not self-evident, and thoughtfully plan the manner in which a user will interact with the app and as many ranges of experiences with it as possible.

I was personally invested in designing this app; I would have found it useful as a freshman. It was terrifying for me to ask for help, so I usually just put up a front of things being fine when they weren't, which can be unhealthy and even dangerous, depending on the circumstances. My teammates and I handled the project seriously, as though we were actually planning this product for real implementation and use. It was a joy to work with them, and there is no such thing as too many perspectives in human-centered design. Design is important to me and I took the final prototype as a personal challenge to create a seamless, intuitive, rich experience with invisible design, the best kind. Now I can move forward with experience, knowledge, and tools for designing not just apps or products, but *experiences*.
