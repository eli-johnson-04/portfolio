# Introduction to Software Engineering
*Recipe Drop* is my semester project for CEN3031 - Introduction to Software Engineering. I worked as the project manager of a team of four, including myself. For this project we were tasked with designing and implementing an online recipe book. We named ourselves the Chop Shop, and set out to make our Recipe Drop, the next-up recipe book! 

## Duties
Throughout this project I oversaw administration of the project alongside Samuel Morse, our Scrum Master. I organized team meetings and Agile activities, conducted peer programming sessions, and I ensured both the depth and quality of our documentation. 

We composed and delivered live project presentations at regular intervals, including a pitch, update presentations, and a final presentation. We did daily scrum activities, reviewed each other's work, and each of us participated in design and development.
