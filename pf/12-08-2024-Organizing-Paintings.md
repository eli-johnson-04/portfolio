# Algorithm Design
Leading a team I designed, proved, and tested implementations (Python & C++) of six algorithms across a range of algorithmic design paradigms. Solutions included **two greedy** and **four dynamic programming** solutions to the same minimization problem. Drawing on a variety of sources I composed Bellman equations, effective pseudocode, and formal proofs.

# Problem Statement
A strictly-ordered set of paintings, each with its own height and width, must be split into rows of a specified maximum width, while minimizing the combined height of the rows when stacked upon one another. The height of a row is determined by the tallest painting on it. The solutions tackle a variety of subsets of this general problem.

# Reflection
In class I was thoroughly instructed on algorithmic design paradigms and rigorously tested on my understanding of their structure, but above all this project fostered a far greater understanding than the lectures and optional homework did. As such, I took it seriously and composed professional documentation detailing algorithm definitions, time and correctness proofs for each algorithm, results of the experimental study, and an analysis of the results with a thorough comparison of performance. That documentation is available [here](https://github.com/eli-johnson-04/aad-project). My team and I received full marks.
